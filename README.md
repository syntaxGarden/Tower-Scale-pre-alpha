# Tower-Scale-pre-alpha

This is the first pre-alpha version of Tower Scale, a game by Syntax Garden Studios. This version of the game features:
 * Full player movement, including normal walking, jumping, and dodging.
 * A grapple mechanic and 3 grapple points in the test area to try it out.
 * A slowdown mechanic that acts as bullet time. It will run out if used too much and will be unusable until a full recharge.
 * An Out-Of-Bounds reset system (just a simple if statement so you can't fall off the world forever).
 * A secret debug menu that can be accessed in-game through a small cheat code (I won't tell you what it is, but it shouldn't be too hard to find it)

Since this is a pre-alpha build (intended to be very early but still contain representative mechanics) it is still missing a number of things that are intended for later pre-alpha and alpha builds.
These things include:
 * An options menu with some basic options, and a remappable controls menu.
 * A basic save system to save the player's options and controls (that would be used as a prototype for a full save system).
 * A gun for the player to break down walls and hurt enemies with.
 * Areas and objects that damage the player, which immobilises them and acts as a punishment.
 * More objects for the player to interact with for movement options.
 * A system for dialogue to appear on-screen which does not lock the gameplay.

  There is still a long way to go with the game. But the ground work has been laid, and this is the fruits of my labour. <br />
